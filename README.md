# NashViva!
_A digital pocketknife for life in Nashville_

NashViva uses data from Metro Nashville's open data portal to display where public services are located in Nashville.

While this information is generally available throughout the [official Metro Nashville](https://www.nashville.gov/) site, this application serves provides a unique service by gathering them into one place.  We believe we can leverage this to offer unique features.

## Running
This site is all static JS/HTML/CSS, so you can use any "server in a box". For Python 3, you can use the built-in `python3 -m http.server`. For Node, check out [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Check out the issues page to squash üêõs, add features, and report issues or suggest enhancements.

## Deployment
This repository is configured to serve the site using Github Pages right off the master branch. You should be able to see your changes a minute or two after it is merged to master ‚ú®!
